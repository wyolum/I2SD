I2SD is an I2C interface for an SD card to be used initally with ClockTHREE and
ClockTHREEjr.  The idea behind I2SD is to allow easy access to files stored
on an SD card.  If the I2C bus is already part of a circuit, I2SD does 
not require any extra pins.  So it it be used to optimize pin usage on the
micro.

I2SD has a simple single file interface.  That is only one file can
be open at a time.

Typical usage:

I2SD sd = I2SD();
i2sd.open("tryme.txt", FILE_WRITE); 
i2sd.write("To be or not to be, that is the question\n");

i2sd.open("tryme.txt", FILE_READ);
i2sd.read(uint8_t* c, 1); // c == 'T'
i2sd.read(uint8_t* all, 100); 
// all = "o be or not to be, that is the question\n"

If any call fails, then I2SD will start rapidly alternating LED blinks to 
indicate a failure and return an error code.  So test the output of 
each call if you can respond to errors internally.

Long reads happen most efficiently if the reads occur in blocks of size
I2C_BUFFER_LEN - 1: 31.  If not, a seek is preformed to realign the SD
file back to what will be expected.  This results in a loss of efficiency 
for two reasons:
    1. a seek uses the bus
    2. data is always sent from I2SD_Slave in 32 byte chunks. 
      (save one byte for I2SD_READ_MSG: 32 = 1 + 31)
